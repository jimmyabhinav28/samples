Repository for sample applications while learning spring for application development
First application:
Has two endpoints, one for GET and one for POST, which will log all the parameters that are being passed via headers, path parameters, query parameters and request body
Test this application with any of the available rest clients (Postman).
Use swagger for API documentation and slueth and zipkin for log correlation.

Second application
Will have clients for endpoints that you wrote in the first application. Run first application and second application in tandem and test.
